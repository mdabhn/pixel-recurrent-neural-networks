Generative Adversarial Networks use Adversarial loss to train there models. Hard to optimize.

Adversarial loss - It is a binary classifier that differentiates between ground truth data and generated data predicted by the generative network.

Autoregressive Models are cnn nd rnn models.

How pixel RNN works - sequence of pixels going row by row. each pixel dependend on previous one that have been generated already.
The last layer of rnn is softmax layer it has 256 values for each pixels which represents the probabilities of those intensity values.
Architecture - 
An image goes through a convulational layer followed by several residual blocks which can be convulational layers or lstm layers than again a convulational layer followed by a softmax layer.
