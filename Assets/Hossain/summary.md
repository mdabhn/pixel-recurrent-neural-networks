# Summary of the paper

    How Generative Modeling works?

    - it helps to genarte new data from INPUT X with LABEL Y. By using the join probability of (X,Y)

---

    Where we use that?

    - we use that in different fields. Like image compression, image classification, image reconstruction etc.

---

    What is autoagressive Rnn model?

    - We predict a pixel by its all previously generated pixels.

---

    Cnn extract information independent of time but Rnn can loop through and can work.

---

    While Rnn is bad for long term depecndency we use LSTM. It adds gates to Rnn so it can have long term memory.
