Difference between CNN and RNN

They are both different architecture’s of neural nets that perform well on different types of data.
RNNs are good with series of data (one thing happens after another) and are used a lot in problems 
that can be framed as “what will happen next given…” while CNNs are especially good at problems like image classification.
